# Bracketize

This Chrome extension comes from the need to copy your IDE behaviour to your browser.

The first behaviour I want to tackle is the possibility to quickly surround a word with a few particular characters.

List of particular characters:

- `(` => applies `()` around the selected word/sentence
- `[` => applies `[]` around the selected word/sentence
- `{` => applies `{}` around the selected word/sentence
- `'` => applies `''` around the selected word/sentence
- `"` => applies `""` around the selected word/sentence
- `*` => applies `**` around the selected word/sentence

## Notes

- This extension is in a **beta** release, so it can have a few unexpected behaviour that I (try to) fix as I go along using it.
- This is a very simple extension, so it might not work for elaborate websites (e.g. facebook.com, workplace.com, gmail.com)
